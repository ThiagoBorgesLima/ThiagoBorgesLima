## Data Science Projects

[House Rocket-> Insights](https://github.com/ThiagoBorgesLima/House_Rocket)

![Sales](https://github.com/ThiagoBorgesLima/House_Rocket/blob/master/imgs/house1.jpg)

House Rocket's CEO would like to maximize the company's revenue by finding good business opportunities. Your main strategy is to buy good properties in great locations at low prices and then resell them later at higher prices. The greater the difference between buying and selling, the greater the company's profit and therefore the greater its revenue. However, properties have many attributes that make them more or less attractive to buyers and sellers, and location and time of year can also influence prices.


[Rossmann Sales -> Regression](https://github.com/ThiagoBorgesLima/Rossman-Store-Sales)

![Sales](https://github.com/ThiagoBorgesLima/Rossman-Store-Sales/blob/main/imgs/rossmann.jpeg)

Rossmann is one of largest drug store chain in Europe, operating over 3,000 drug stores in 7 countries across the continent.

Recently, the CFO received the task to renovate Rossmann stores and, in order to decide the amount of money each store will receive in the next period budget for renovation, he or she wants to know how much each store will sell in the next six weeks.

The gross expected income of the majority of stores is in the range between R$5000.00 and R$22000.00. The chain is expected to obtain R$283,198,749.24, with best and worst case scenarios of R$284,604,871.47 and R$283,901,824.00, respectively. These scenarios are predicted using statistical errors (mean absolute percentage error).



[Insurance All -> Classification](https://github.com/ThiagoBorgesLima/health_insurance)

![insurance](https://github.com/ThiagoBorgesLima/health_insurance/blob/master/references/health.jpeg)

A health insurance company intends to offer its customers a new product, a vehicle insurance. In order to achieve this purpose efficiently, it gathered some information about their customers and asked if they would be interested in purchasing a new vehicle insurance. This information was passed on to a Data Science Consulting office.

The office delivered a report informing, among all features gathered, the most relevant ones and the probability of purchase from each customer.



[Mobility Cars -> Regression](https://github.com/ThiagoBorgesLima/mobility_cars_hack02)

( Competition Code used for HackDays 02 from Comunidade DS )

A rental car company wants to sell used cars for a best price when they want to renove their fleet of cars. For the best selling values, we can use their data about the cars and create a Linear Regression model to improve the gain.

Mean Absolute Error before: $ 100000,00

Mean Absolute Error after: $ 25370,00

[Credit Client -> Classification](https://github.com/ThiagoBorgesLima/credit_client_hack03)

![credit](https://github.com/ThiagoBorgesLima/credit_client_hack03/blob/master/credit_client.jpeg)
( Competition Code used for HackDays 03 from Comunidade DS )

A bank wants to study the churn that they are suffering. They think this are ocurring because their hard and low system to give more credit to clients and send us some data to study the problem.
With Data Scince project we can improve the classification of their clients with 88% of assertiveness to receive more credit and only use seconds to do this.

[Insiders Classification -> Clustering](https://github.com/ThiagoBorgesLima/insiders_clustering)

![credit](https://github.com/ThiagoBorgesLima/insiders_clustering/blob/master/data/insiders.png)

A online store wants do classificate their clients in "insiders" group to receive some gains about theis expends and for improve sales.
